hypos - bare-metal type-1 hypervisor for fun. lots of things
to learn, I thought why not put them all together into one
tiny project.

My view for this project:

(1) Fully debugable ARMv8 (arm64) hypervisor (from scratch)
    trace infos through the whole project.
    (i.e. from assembly to C)

(2) Can be run on QEMU

(3) Key components
    (a) Console (Terminal)
    (b) Debug LED
    (c) CPU vituraliztion
    (d) Memory vituraliztion

(4) Set up and compile easily

Under Development
